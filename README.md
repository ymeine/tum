The Ultimate Manager
===

Introduction
====

Everything in life has to be managed.

This project first started as an idea about applications management, something close to what we usually know as packages managers in the Unix world, but that we can also find everywhere, especially knowadays with the concept of Apps Markets.

Then, it turned out to managing any kind of data, like musics (more generally multimedia), documents (administratives for instance), projects and so on: we call all of this contents. Therefore, we come to a known concept: Content Management System (CMS). However, the goal is clearly to manage content, not to build a website (this would be only the GUI part).

The thing is that managing contents is a problematic well known with current CMS, DBMS... Thus, the focus has to be done on concepts, design... and on the (G)UI part. This has to be efficient and ergonomic, centered around human workflows.

This led to managing components of an applications, like intelligent auto-building modular systems, focused on End User Programming. This is related to current frameworks to build applications.

Finally, doing such a project, as any project IMHO, requires a good management of knowledge.

As you see, everything has to be managed: contents, components, knowledge, etc.
